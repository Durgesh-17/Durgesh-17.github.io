### Problem Statement

> **QUESTION 1**: As a senior backend engineer at Jovian, you are tasked with developing a fast in-memory data structure to manage profile information (username, name and email) for 100 million users. It should allow the following operations to be performed efficiently:
>
> 1. **Insert** the profile information for a new user.
> 2. **Find** the profile information of a user, given their username
> 3. **Update** the profile information of a user, given their usrname
> 4. **List** all the users of the platform, sorted by username
>
> You can assume that usernames are unique.

#### Problem

> We need to create a data structure which can store 100 million records and perform insertion, search, update and list operations efficiently.

#### Input

The key inputs to our data structure are user profiles, which contain the username, name and email of a user.

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, username, name, email):
        self.username = username
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

    def __repr__(self):
        return "User(username='{}', name='{}', email='{}')".format(self.username, self.name, self.email)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.__repr__()
```

let's create some users,

```python
aakash = User('aakash', 'Aakash Rai', 'aakash@example.com')
biraj = User('biraj', 'Biraj Das', 'biraj@example.com')
hemanth = User('hemanth', 'Hemanth Jain', 'hemanth@example.com')
jadhesh = User('jadhesh', 'Jadhesh Verma', 'jadhesh@example.com')
siddhant = User('siddhant', 'Siddhant Sinha', 'siddhant@example.com')
sonaksh = User('sonaksh', 'Sonaksh Kumar', 'sonaksh@example.com')
vishal = User('vishal', 'Vishal Goel', 'vishal@example.com')
```

```python
users = [aakash, biraj, hemanth, jadhesh, siddhant, sonaksh, vishal]
```

#### Output

We can also express our desired data structure as a Python class `UserDatabase` with four methods: `insert`, `find`, `update` and `list_all`.

```python
class UserDatabase:
    def insert(self, user):
        pass

    def find(self, username):
        pass

    def update(self, user):
        pass

    def list_all(self):
        pass
```

Here's a simple and easy solution to the problem: we store the `User` objects in a list sorted by usernames.

The various functions can be implemented as follows:

1. **Insert**: Loop through the list and add the new user at a position that keeps the list sorted.
2. **Find**: Loop through the list and find the user object with the username matching the query.
3. **Update**: Loop through the list, find the user object matching the query and update the details
4. **List**: Return the list of user objects.

We can use the fact usernames, which are are strings can be compared using the `<`, `>` and `==` operators in Python.

```python
class UserDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = []

    def insert(self, user):
        i = 0
        while i < len(self.users):
            # Find the first username greater than the new user's username
            if self.users[i].username > user.username:
                break
            i += 1
        self.users.insert(i, user)

    def find(self, username):
        for user in self.users:
            if user.username == username:
                return user

    def update(self, user):
        target = self.find(user.username)
        target.name, target.email = user.name, user.email

    def list_all(self):
        return self.users
```

We can create a new database of users by _instantiating_ and object of the `UserDatabase` class.

```python
database = UserDatabase()
```

### Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies

The operations `insert`, `find`, `update` involves iterating over a list of users, in the worst case, they may take up to `N` iterations to return a result, where `N` is the total number of users. `list_all` however, simply returns the existing internal list of users.

Thus, the time complexities of the various operations are:

1. Insert: **O(N)**
2. Find: **O(N)**
3. Update: **O(N)**
4. List: **O(1)**

## Balanced Binary Search Trees

![bst](/assets/img/bst.png)

For our use case, we require the binary tree to have some additional properties:

1. **Keys and Values**: Each node of the tree stores a key (a username) and a value (a `User` object). Only keys are shown in the picture above for brevity. A binary tree where nodes have both a key and a value is often referred to as a **map** or **treemap** (because it maps keys to values).
2. **Binary Search Tree**: The _left subtree_ of any node only contains nodes with keys that are lexicographically smaller than the node's key, and the _right subtree_ of any node only contains nodes with keys that lexicographically larger than the node's key. A tree that satisfies this property is called a **binary search trees**, and it's easy to locate a specific key by traversing a single path down from the root note.
3. **Balanced Tree**: The tree is **balanced** i.e. it does not skew too heavily to one side or the other. The left and right subtrees of any node shouldn't differ in height/depth by more than 1 level.

### Height of a Binary Tree

The number of levels in a tree is called its height. As you can tell from the picture above, each level of a tree contains twice as many nodes as the previous level.

For a tree of height `k`, here's a list of the number of nodes at each level:

Level 0: `1`

Level 1: `2`

Level 2: `4` i.e. `2^2`

Level 3: `8` i.e. `2^3`

...

Level k-1: `2^(k-1)`

If the total number of nodes in the tree is `N`, then it follows that

```
N = 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)
```

We can simplify this equation by adding `1` on each side:

```
N + 1 = 1 + 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)

N + 1 = 2^1 + 2^1 + 2^2+ 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)

N + 1 = = 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)

N + 1 = = 2^3 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)

...

N + 1 = 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-1)

N + 1 = 2^k

k = log(N + 1) <= log(N) + 1

```

Thus, to store `N` records we require a balanced binary search tree (BST) of height no larger than `log(N) + 1`. This is a very useful property, in combination with the fact that nodes are arranged in a way that makes it easy to find a specific key by following a single path down from the root.

As we'll see soon, the `insert`, `find` and `update` operations in a balanced BST have time complexity `O(log N)` since they all involve traversing a single path down from the root of the tree.

## Binary Tree

> **QUESTION 2**: Implement a binary tree using Python, and show its usage with some examples.

To begin, we'll create simple binary tree (without any of the additional properties) containing numbers as keys within nodes. Here's an example:

![bt](/assets/img/bt.png)

Here's a simple class representing a node within a binary tree.

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
```

Let's create objects representing each node of the above tree

```python
node0 = TreeNode(3)
node1 = TreeNode(4)
node2 = TreeNode(5)
```

We can connect the nodes by setting the .left and .right properties of the root node.

```python
node0.left = node1
node0.right = node2
```

And we're done! We can create a new variable tree which simply points to the root node, and use it to access all the nodes within the tree.

```python
tree = node0
```

Going forward, we'll use the term "tree" to refer to the root node. The term "node" can refer to any node in a tree, not necessarily the root.

**Exercise:** Create the following binary tree using the `TreeNode` class defined above.

![exercise](/assets/img/exercise.png)

It's a bit inconvenient to create a tree by manually connecting all the nodes. Let's write a helper function which can convert a tuple with the structure ( left_subtree, key, right_subtree) (where left_subtree and right_subtree are themselves tuples) into binary tree.

Here's an tuple representing the tree shown above:

```python
tree_tuple = ((1,3,None), 2, ((None, 3, 4), 5, (6, 7, 8)))
```

```python
def parse_tuple(data):
    # print(data)
    if isinstance(data, tuple) and len(data) == 3:
        node = TreeNode(data[1])
        node.left = parse_tuple(data[0])
        node.right = parse_tuple(data[2])
    elif data is None:
        node = None
    else:
        node = TreeNode(data)
    return node
```

```python
tree = parse_tuple(tree_tuple)
```

**Exercise:** Define a function `tree_to_tuple` that converts a binary tree into a tuple representing the same tree. E.g. `tree_to_tuple` converts the tree created above to the tuple `((1, 3, None), 2, ((None, 3, 4), 5, (6, 7, 8)))`. _Hint_: Use recursion.

```python
def tree_to_tuple(node):
        if node is None:
            return None
        if node.left is None and node.right is None:
            return node.key
        return tree_to_tuple(node.left),  node.key, tree_to_tuple(node.right)
```

Let's create another helper function to display all the keys in a tree-like structure for easier visualization.

```python
def display_keys(node, space='\t', level=0):
    # print(node.key if node else None, level)

    # If the node is empty
    if node is None:
        print(space*level + 'âˆ…')
        return

    # If the node is a leaf
    if node.left is None and node.right is None:
        print(space*level + str(node.key))
        return

    # If the node has children
    display_keys(node.right, space, level+1)
    print(space*level + str(node.key))
    display_keys(node.left,space, level+1)
```

Let's try using the function.

```python
display_keys(tree, '  ')
```

## Traversing a Binary Tree

The following questions are frequently asked in coding interviews and assessments:

> **QUESTION**: Write a function to perform the _inorder_ traversal of a binary tree.

> **QUESTION**: Write a function to perform the _preorder_ traversal of a binary tree.

> **QUESTION**: Write a function to perform the _postorder_ traversal of a binary tree.

A _traversal_ refers to the process of visiting each node of a tree exactly once. _Visiting a node_ generally refers to adding the node's key to a list. There are three ways to traverse a binary tree and return the list of visited keys:

### Inorder traversal

1. Traverse the left subtree recursively inorder.
2. Traverse the current node.
3. Traverse the right subtree recursively inorder.

![inorder](/assets/img/inorder.png)

### Preorder traversal

1. Traverse the current node.
2. Traverse the left subtree recursively preorder.
3. Traverse the right subtree recursively preorder.

![preorder](/assets/img/preorder.png)

Can you guess how **postorder** traversal works??

Here's an implementation of inorder traversal of a binary tree.

```python
def traverse_in_order(node):
    if node is None:
        return []
    return(traverse_in_order(node.left) +
           [node.key] +
           traverse_in_order(node.right))
```

## Height and Size of a Binary Tree

> **QUESTION**: Write a function to calculate the height/depth of a binary tree

> **QUESTION**: Write a function to count the number of nodes in a binary tree

The _height/depth_ of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path from its root node to a leaf. It can be computed recursively, as follows:

```python
def tree_height(node):
    if node is None:
        return 0
    return 1 + max(tree_height(node.left), tree_height(node.right))
```

Here's a function to count the number of nodes in a binary tree.

```python
def tree_size(node):
    if node is None:
        return 0
    return 1 + tree_size(node.left) + tree_size(node.right)
```

As a final step, let's compile all the functions we've written so far as methods withing the TreeNode class itself. Encapsulation of data and functionality within the same class is a good programming practice.

```python
class TreeNode():
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key, self.left, self.right = key, None, None

    def height(self):
        if self is None:
            return 0
        return 1 + max(TreeNode.height(self.left), TreeNode.height(self.right))

    def min_height(self):
        if self in None:
            return 0
        elif self.left is None:
            return 1 + TreeNode.min_height(self.right)
        elif self.right is None:
            return 1 + TreeNode.min_height(self.left)
        return 1 + min(TreeNode.min_height(self.left), TreeNode.min_height(self.right))

    def size(self):
        if self is None:
            return 0
        return 1 + TreeNode.size(self.left) + TreeNode.size(self.right)

    def diameter():
        self.diameter = 0

        def get_max_depth(node):
            if node is None:
                return 0
            left_max_depth = get_max_depth(node.left)
            right_max_depth = get_max_depth(node.right)
            self.diameter = max(self.diameter, left_max_depth+right_max_depth)
            return 1 + max(left_max_depth,right_max_depth)

        get_max_depth(self)
        return self.diameter

    def traverse_in_order(self):
        if self is None:
            return []
        return (TreeNode.traverse_in_order(self.left) +
                [self.key] +
                TreeNode.traverse_in_order(self.right))

    def traverse_preorder(self):
        if self in None:
            return []
        return ([self.key]+TreeNode.traverse_preorder(self.left)+
        TreeNode.traverse_preorder(self.right))

    def traverse_postorder(self):
        if self is None:
            return []
        return (Treenode.traverse_postorder(self.left)+
        TreeNode.traverse_postorder(self.right)+[self.key])


    def display_keys(self, space='\t', level=0):
        # If the node is empty
        if self is None:
            print(space*level + 'âˆ…')
            return

        # If the node is a leaf
        if self.left is None and self.right is None:
            print(space*level + str(self.key))
            return

        # If the node has children
        display_keys(self.right, space, level+1)
        print(space*level + str(self.key))
        display_keys(self.left,space, level+1)

    def to_tuple(self):
        if self is None:
            return None
        if self.left is None and self.right is None:
            return self.key
        return TreeNode.to_tuple(self.left),  self.key, TreeNode.to_tuple(self.right)

    def __str__(self):
        return "BinaryTree <{}>".format(self.to_tuple())

    def __repr__(self):
        return "BinaryTree <{}>".format(self.to_tuple())

    @staticmethod
    def parse_tuple(data):
        if data is None:
            node = None
        elif isinstance(data, tuple) and len(data) == 3:
            node = TreeNode(data[1])
            node.left = TreeNode.parse_tuple(data[0])
            node.right = TreeNode.parse_tuple(data[2])
        else:
            node = TreeNode(data)
        return node
```

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

A binary search tree or BST is a binary tree that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The left subtree of any node only contains nodes with keys less than the node's key
2. The right subtree of any node only contains nodes with keys greater than the node's key

It follows from the above conditions that every subtree of a binary search tree must also be a binary search tree.

> **QUESTION**: Write a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree (BST).

> **QUESTION**: Write a function to find the maximum key in a binary tree.

> **QUESTION**: Write a function to find the minimum key in a binary tree.

Here's a function that covers all of the above:

```python
def remove_none(nums):
    return [x for x in nums if x is not None]

def is_bst(node):
    if node is None:
        return True, None, None

    is_bst_l, min_l, max_l = is_bst(node.left)
    is_bst_r, min_r, max_r = is_bst(node.right)

    is_bst_node = (is_bst_l and is_bst_r and
              (max_l is None or node.key > max_l) and
              (min_r is None or node.key < min_r))

    min_key = min(remove_none([min_l, node.key, min_r]))
    max_key = max(remove_none([max_l, node.key, max_r]))

    # print(node.key, min_key, max_key, is_bst_node)

    return is_bst_node, min_key, max_key
```

## Storing Key-Value Pairs using BSTs

Recall that we need to store user objects with each key in our BST. Let's define new class `BSTNode` to represent the nodes of of our tree. Apart from having properties `key`, `left` and `right`, we'll also store a `value` and pointer to the parent node (for easier upward traversal).

```python
class BSTNode():
    def __init__(self, key, value=None):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.parent = None
```

Let's try to recreate this BST with usernames as keys and user objects as values:
![bst](/assets/img/bst.png)

```python
tree = BSTNode(jadhesh.username, jadhesh)
tree.left = BSTNode(biraj.username, biraj)
tree.right = BSTNode(sonaksh.username, sonaksh)
.
..
...
#here jadhesh,biraj,sonaksh are the instance of User class created earlier
```

### Insertion into BST

> **QUESTION**: Write a function to insert a new node into a BST.

We use the BST-property to perform insertion efficiently:

1. Starting from the root node, we compare the key to be inserted with the current node's key
2. If the key is smaller, we recursively insert it in the left subtree (if it exists) or attach it as as the left child if no left subtree exists.
3. If the key is larger, we recursively insert it in the right subtree (if it exists) or attach it as as the right child if no right subtree exists.

Here's a recursive implementation of `insert`.

```python
def insert(node, key, value):
    if node is None:
        node = BSTNode(key, value)
    elif key < node.key:
        node.left = insert(node.left, key, value)
        node.left.parent = node
    elif key > node.key:
        node.right = insert(node.right, key, value)
        node.right.parent = node
    return node
```

```python
tree = insert(None, jadhesh.username, jadhesh)
insert(tree, biraj.username, biraj)
insert(tree, sonaksh.username, sonaksh)
insert(tree, aakash.username, aakash)
insert(tree, hemanth.username, hemanth)
insert(tree, siddhant.username, siddhant)
insert(tree, vishal.username, siddhant)
```

Note, however, that the order of insertion of nodes change the structure of the resulting tree.

```python
tree2 = insert(None, aakash.username, aakash)
insert(tree2, biraj.username, biraj)
insert(tree2, hemanth.username, hemanth)
insert(tree2, jadhesh.username, jadhesh)
insert(tree2, siddhant.username, siddhant)
insert(tree2, sonaksh.username, sonaksh)
insert(tree2, vishal.username, vishal)
```

![skewed](/assets/img/skewed.png)

Skewed/unbalanced BSTs are problematic because the height of such trees often ceases to logarithmic compared to the number of nodes in the tree. For instance the above tree has 7 nodes and height 7.

The length of the path traversed by `insert` is equal to the height of the tree (in the worst case). It follows that if the tree is balanced, the time complexity of insertion is `O(log N)` otherwise it is `O(N)`.

### Finding a Node in BST

> **QUESTION**: Find the value associated with a given key in a BST.

We can follow a recursive strategy similar to insertion to find the node with a given key within a BST.

```python
def find(node, key):
    if node is None:
        return None
    if key == node.key:
        return node
    if key < node.key:
        return find(node.left, key)
    if key > node.key:
        return find(node.right, key)
```

### Updating a value in a BST

> **QUESTION:** Write a function to update the value associated with a given key within a BST

We can use `find` to locate the node to be updated, and simply update it's value.

```python
def update(node, key, value):
    target = find(node, key)
    if target is not None:
        target.value = value
```

### List the nodes

> **QUESTION:** Write a function to retrieve all the key-values pairs stored in a BST in the sorted order of keys.

The nodes can be listed in sorted order by performing an inorder traversal of the BST.

```python
def list_all(node):
    if node is None:
        return []
    return list_all(node.left) + [(node.key, node.value)] + list_all(node.right)
```

## Balanced Binary Trees

> **QUESTION**: Write a function to determine if a binary tree is balanced.

Here's a recursive strategy:

1. Ensure that the left subtree is balanced.
2. Ensure that the right subtree is balanced.
3. Ensure that the difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree is not more than 1.

```python
def is_balanced(node):
    if node is None:
        return True, 0
    balanced_l, height_l = is_balanced(node.left)
    balanced_r, height_r = is_balanced(node.right)
    balanced = balanced_l and balanced_r and abs(height_l - height_r) <=1
    height = 1 + max(height_l, height_r)
    return balanced, height
```

## Balanced Binary Search Trees

> **QUESTION**: Write a function to create a balanced BST from a sorted list/array of key-value pairs.

We can use a recursive strategy here, turning the middle element of the list into the root, and recursively creating left and right subtrees.

```python
def make_balanced_bst(data, lo=0, hi=None, parent=None):
    if hi is None:
        hi = len(data) - 1
    if lo > hi:
        return None

    mid = (lo + hi) // 2
    key, value = data[mid]

    root = BSTNode(key, value)
    root.parent = parent
    root.left = make_balanced_bst(data, lo, mid-1, root)
    root.right = make_balanced_bst(data, mid+1, hi, root)

    return root

```

## Balancing an Unbalanced BST

> **QUESTION:** Write a function to balance an unbalanced binary search tree.

We first perform an inorder traversal, then create a balanced BST using the function defined earlier.

```python
def balance_bst(node):
    return make_balanced_bst(list_all(node))
```

Complexity of the various operations in a balanced BST:

- Insert - O(log N) + O(N) = O(N)
- Find - O(log N)
- Update - O(log N)
- List all - O(N)

## A Python-Friendly Treemap

We are now ready to return to our original problem statement.
We can create a generic class `TreeMap` which supports all the operations specified in the original problem statement in a python-friendly manner.

```python
class TreeMap():
    def __init__(self):
