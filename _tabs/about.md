## Hi there!

I'm Durgesh, a passionate and dedicated IITB student with a strong interest in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), web development, and machine learning (ML). I believe that technology has the power to transform the world we live in, and I'm driven by the desire to contribute to that transformation.

Through this website, I aim to share my knowledge, experiences, and projects with the wider community. I hope to inspire and empower others who share my passion for DSA, web development, and ML. You'll find a collection of my projects, blog posts, and resources that I've found valuable along my learning journey.

Thank you for visiting my website :)
